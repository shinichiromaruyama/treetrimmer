TreeTrimmer is a bioinformatics procedure that removes unnecessary redundancy in large phylogenetic datasets, reducing the size effect on more rigorous downstream analyses. The method identifies and removes user-defined ‘redundant’ sequences, e.g., orthologous sequences from closely related organisms and ‘recently’ evolved lineage-specific paralogs. Representative OTUs are retained for more rigorous re-analysis.
